# LeetCode Submissions

Welcome to my LeetCode Submissions repository! Here, I upload my daily solutions to various LeetCode problems. Each solution is saved as a separate file in the root directory.


## Usage

1. **Find the solution file**: Each file is named following the pattern `<problem_number>_problem_name` or a similar naming convention based on the problem title.
2. **Understand the solution**: Each solution file includes comments and explanations to help you understand the approach and logic used.

## Daily Updates

I aim to upload at least one solution per day. Keep an eye on this repository for regular updates and new solutions.

## Algorithms Repository

I also maintain a separate repository that contains detailed explanations and implementations of various algorithms used in my LeetCode solutions. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/mridul0703/Algorithms).

## Contributing

I welcome contributions and suggestions! If you have a better solution or an alternative approach to any problem, feel free to create a pull request.
